Syncwerk Server Core [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/syncwerk/syncwerk-server.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/syncwerk/syncwerk-server)
============

Syncwerk is an open source cloud storage system with features on privacy protection and teamwork. Collections of files are called libraries, and each library can be synced separately. A library can also be encrypted with a user chosen password. Syncwerk also allows users to create groups and easily sharing files into groups.

This is the core component of Syncwerk server. It provides RPC to the web front-end (Restapi) to access files, and provides HTTP APIs to the desktop clients for syncing files.
